## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Fork the template repository to your own user**
If you are working as a team, you can choose one member to fork the template repository to their own user, 
and then share the repository with the rest of the team.


2. **Clone or navigate to the project directory**

   ```bash
   git clone **copied git url**
   ```

   ```bash
   cd QueenB
   ```

2. **Install root dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install server and client dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

   OR:

   - open terminal and run:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

   - open another terminal

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cd server
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration if needed
   cd ..
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode (Recommended)

#### Running Separately

**Start the backend server:**

```bash
npm run server
```

**Start the frontend client (in a new terminal):**

```bash
npm run client
```

#### Running Concurrently

Run both client and server concurrently:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:

- Backend server on http://localhost:5000
- Frontend client on http://localhost:3000 - you can access the application in your browser at this URL.

### Building for Production

1. **Build the React client:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the production server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: If ports 3000 or 5000 are in use, you can change them in the package.json scripts or .env file

2. **Installation issues**: Delete `node_modules` folders and run `npm run install-all` again

3. **API connection issues**: Ensure the backend server is running on port 5000 and the proxy is configured correctly in the client package.json
